# Avoiding Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Circuits

The barren plateau phenomenon is one of the main issues to solve in order to attain practical applications of variational quantum algorithms. This consists of the lack of convergence due to the vanishing of the cost function gradient. In this project, we implement several proposals to avoid barren plateaus in variational algorithms.
